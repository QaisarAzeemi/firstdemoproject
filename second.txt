created second file for remote repository...
now i wil push this file to remote repository.
I am making a few changes in my file to pull it on local repository.
previously i made changes in first.txt and fetch these changes on my local repository using git fetch command.
but changes didn't applied 
so 
to apply changes i have to write git merge command on my terminal
now
here
i am just writing git pull to make changes on my local file.
